Journal is a native Android app for recording and reading simple text entries.
* Uses Google authentication to sign in (but no cloud sync implemented)
* All data stored in the device data directory in a SQLite database.
* User can add an entry via (+) button. Upon clicking "Save" the entry is added to the database.
* User can read their old entries by clicking the history button. Data from the database is loaded into a recyclerview in descending order by timestamp.
